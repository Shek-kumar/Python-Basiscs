# Python dictionary is an ordered collection of items. 
# It stores elements in key/value pairs.
# Here, keys are unique identifiers that are associated with each value.


# create a dictionary named capital_city
capital_city = {'Nepal': 'Kathmandu', 'Italy': 'Rome', 'England': 'London'}
print()
print(capital_city) # prints elements of capital_city 
print()

# We use keys to retrieve the respective value. But not the other way around.
print(capital_city['Nepal'])  # prints Kathmandu
print()

print(capital_city['Kathmandu'])  # throws error message
