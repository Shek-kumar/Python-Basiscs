# Encapsulation is one of the key features of object-oriented programming.
#  Encapsulation refers to the bundling of attributes and methods inside a single class.

# It prevents outer classes from accessing and changing attributes and methods of a class.
#  This also helps to achieve data hiding.

# In Python, we denote private attributes using underscore as the prefix 
# i.e single _ or double __. 
 


 
# For example,

class Computer:

    def __init__(self):
        self.__maxprice = 900

    def sell(self):
        print("Selling Price: {}".format(self.__maxprice))

    def setMaxPrice(self, price):
        self.__maxprice = price

c = Computer()
c.sell()

# trying to change the price 
c.__maxprice = 1000
c.sell()     # since __maxprice is a private variable thats why no change takes place in the value


# using setter function to change the price which takes price as parameter
c.setMaxPrice(1000)
c.sell()
